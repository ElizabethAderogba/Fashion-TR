      <h2>I've got a Crush...</h2>
      <p class="dearDariaPost"><strong>Dear Daria, I'm 18 and
          have a crush on my classmate. He doesn't notice me because I'm shy. What can I wear to grab his attention?
        </strong>
        <br><em> Ahh, puppy love. I remember back in highschool, when I was nerdy and shy but crushing on the popular
          guys! I definitey had no style nor an agony aunt to ask! Rest assured your fashion auntie is here. The
          Pantone colour of the year is pink, so definitely try to include some pink accents with your clothes, like
          little pink bows or pink lace camis. It will be sure to grab his attention but still make you look like you
          aren't trying too hard. Best of luck. </em></br>

      <h2>Trouble at Work...</h2>
      <p class="dearDariaPost"><strong>Dear Daria, I've just
          started a new job in a new city where I don't know anyone. My parent's keep nagging me about finding a
          boyfriend because I'm "not getting any younger!" My boss keeps trying to invite me out to dinner, but I
          don't know what to wear! Help me out? </strong>
        <br> <em>This is sounding like a Bridget Jones novel... a perfect occasion for the LBD. (Little Black Dress!)
          and style it up with accessories and some kitten heels. It's a timeless, classy look. P.S GET THAT
          PAY RISE!</em></br>

      <h2>City girl...</h2>
      <p class="dearDariaPost"><strong>Dear Daria, my cat
          peed all over my clothes for tonights date, he's a banker taking me out somewhere fancy and I don't have any
          other classy dresses! What should I do?</strong><br><em> First of all, why do you only own one dress? This is
          a
          fashion CRIME. You're going to have to go with a simple smart casual outfit, dressed up with heels and a
          vintage red lip. Goodluck and do not disappoint me again!</em> </br></p>
